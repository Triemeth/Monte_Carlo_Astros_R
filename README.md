# Monte_Carlo_Astros_R


## Goal/Overview
This project aims to simulate the 2022 world series between the Astros and Philies using the monto carlo method using R.

## Data/EDA:
The data is obtained from the Lahman package. The EDA at the beginning portion of the quato file is of all teams from 2010 to 2022. Then later compares between only the Astros and philies. Correlation between all variable and weather it was a win or a loss is checked. P values are ranked to see the highest correlation weather a team wins or loses is outputted for later use.

## Simulation:
A formula is created using the top 5 variables for both wins and losses. The seven game serious is then simulated. The model tends to predict the outcome of the seris as a whole correctly but not the out come of a specific game. This makes sense due to 

## Libraries:
* tidyverse
* Lahman
* Patwork
* dplyr
* ggcorrplot
* Car
